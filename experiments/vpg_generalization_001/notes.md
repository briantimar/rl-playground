## Problems with this experiment
* I have not attempted any optimization over learning rate, batch size, or total number of episodes

## prelim results
My MLP solutions totally fail to generalize! It's not due to the Cartpole environment terminating early -- it doesn't enforce the 200 step time limit. 
My carts basically balance the pole, but they drift off screen pretty quickly.

## todo:
hyperparam optimization
